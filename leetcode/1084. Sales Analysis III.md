Write an SQL query that reports the products that were only sold in the spring of 2019. That is, between 2019-01-01 and 2019-03-31 inclusive.

Solution1
```sql
select p.product_id, product_name
from product p
left join sales s
on p.product_id = s.product_id
group by p.product_id 
having min(s.sale_date) >= '2019-01-01' and max(s.sale_date) <= '2019-03-31'
```

Solution2
```sql
select product_id, product_name
from product 
where product_id not in (select p.product_id
                        from product p
                        join sales s
                        on p.product_id = s.product_id
                        where s.sale_date NOT BETWEEN '2019-01-01' AND '2019-03-31')
group by product_id
```

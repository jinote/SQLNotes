608. Tree Node

Each node in the tree can be one of three types:

"Leaf": if the node is a leaf node.
"Root": if the node is the root of the tree.
"Inner": If the node is neither a leaf node nor a root node.
Write an SQL query to report the type of each node in the tree.

Return the result table ordered by id in ascending order.

```sql
SELECT id,
CASE WHEN p_id IS NULL THEN 'Root'
    WHEN id IN (SELECT p_id FROM tree) THEN 'Inner'
    ELSE 'Leaf' END AS type
FROM Tree 

```

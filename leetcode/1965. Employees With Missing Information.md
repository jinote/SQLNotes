Write an SQL query to report the IDs of all the employees with missing information. The information of an employee is missing if:

The employee's name is missing, or
The employee's salary is missing.
Return the result table ordered by employee_id in ascending order.

The query result format is in the following example.

```sql
select e.employee_id
  from employees e
  left join salaries s
  using(employee_id)
  where salary is null
union all
select s.employee_id
  from employees e
  right join salaries s
  using(employee_id)
  where name is null
order by employee_id;
```

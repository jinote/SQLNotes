A company's executives are interested in seeing who earns the most money in each of the company's departments. A high earner in a department is an employee who has a salary in the top three unique salaries for that department.

Write an SQL query to find the employees who are high earners in each of the departments.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

Employee table: id, name, salary, departmentid
Department table: id, name

```sql
SELECT 
FROM (SELECT e.name AS Employee, d.name AS Department, e.salary AS Salary,
             DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY d.name ORDER BY e.salary DESC) AS "Rank"
      FROM Employee e, Department d
      WHERE e.departmentid = d.id) from2
 WHERE c.from2.rank <= 3
```

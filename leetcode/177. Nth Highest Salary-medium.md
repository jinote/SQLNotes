177. Nth Highest Salary
Write an SQL query to report the nth highest salary from the Employee table. 
If there is no nth highest salary, the query should report null.

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
  RETURN (
      # Write your MySQL query statement below.
      SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee E1
      WHERE N =
      (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(E2.Salary)) FROM Employee E2
      WHERE E2.Salary >= E1.Salary)
      
  );
END
```

Write an SQL query to find the daily active user count for a period of 30 days ending 2019-07-27 inclusively. 
A user was active on someday if they made at least one activity on that day.

Solution1
```sql
SELECT activity_date as day, COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as active_usrs
FROM Activity
WHERE activity_date BETWEEN '2019-06-28' AND '2019-07-27'
GROUP BY 1
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) >= 1 
```

Solution2
```sql
SELECT activity_date as day, COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as active_users
FROM Activity
WHERE activity_date BETWEEN date_add('2019-07-27', INTERVAL -29 day) AND '2019-07-27'
GROUP BY activity_date
```
